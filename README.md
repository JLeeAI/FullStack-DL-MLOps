# FullStack-DL-MLOps
Resources for full stack deep learning and MLOps 

### Full Stack Deep Learning 2021
- **UC Berkeley 2021** [webpage](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/spring2021/) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1T8fO7ArWlcWg04OgNiJy91PywMKT2lv)
- Great resources to create an end-to-end ML/AI project
- It covers issues that can be easily dismissed in DL courses in research.
  - Topics : DL Fundamentals, CNN, Computer Vision, RNN, Transformers, ML projects, Infrastructure, Tooling, Troubleshooting, Data Management, Ethics, Testing, Deployment, Research, Teams, and Projects. 

### Machine Learning Systems Design
- **Stanford, Winter 2021** [webpage](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html)
- It covers general topics to design and deploy ML/AI services in real-world.
  - Topics : Understanding ML production, Intro to ML systems design, Data engineering, Model developemnt, Model evaluation, Deployment, Scaling, Monitoring and maintenance, Infrastructure, and Integrating ML into business.
> we’ll go over how ML systems are different from both ML in research (or in school) and traditional software, which motivates the need for this framework. We’ll also analyze some common misunderstandings we often come across when talking to people who haven’t deployed ML systems. (in the lecture 1 note)

### MLOps
- MLOps gets more attentions from industry and spreads to research areas.
- Google MLOps: concised and well-explained [webpage](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning)
- An introduction to MLOps on Google Cloud (Sep 2020) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gdrwFMaEZ0)
- A Chat with Andrew on MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI (Mar 2021) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo)
- Andrew Ng: Bridging AI's Proof-of-Concept to Production Gap (Sep 2020) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsPuVAMaADY)

### Deep Learning in Production
- the ai summer [github](https://github.com/The-AI-Summer/Deep-Learning-In-Production) | [webpage](https://theaisummer.com/)
- Haven't gone through yet. It seems cover most of topics realted with deploying prototype DLs.
